**Brief:** This homework is based on (64) face pictures taken under various lightning conditions.
In order to run this  notebook you will have to download their containing directory from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1N5wiBWaPXSc-9QzE_pG9CcOG95SDvN4Z?usp=sharing)

During implementation I have studied and learned :   

**1.] What is Logistic regression and how it can work.**

**2.] Overfiting /underfitting phenomenon , causes and ways to prevent.**

**3.] Ridge regression.**

**4.] Preproccessing face images in order to train and test a recognition software.**


**5.] Dimension reduction with P.C.A. and how is the data loss quantified.Examples for dim=9 and dim=30.**



**6.] Nearest Neighbor classification.**


**7.] Singular Value Decomposition.**

**8.] Data Reconstruction.**


**For 640 images = 10 persons:**

Time : <1 min
